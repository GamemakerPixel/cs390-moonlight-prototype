Rougelike dungeon generation
Enemies can quickly kill the player in human form
Enemies will run towards the player attempting to do melee damage.
Player can run in human form, but will have stamina, limited to around 5 seconds
Player can loot chests for healing items and moonlight bottles
Player can enter werewolf form by standing below a moonlight window or drinking a moonlight bottle
Player will lose manual control and pursue the nearest enemy when in werewolf form (ideally accompanied by 
cool red visual effects)
Player will one-shot enemies when in werewolf form.
Enemies will switch to fleeing the player when they're in werewolf form.
Player will have a "moonlight" indicator appear in the UI, after which they will fall to the ground for
a 1 second recovery period, after which they will get up and have to wait for stamina to regenerate.
(Maybe make this less punishing)
Moonlight is regenerated should the werewolf run under a moonlight window.
Maybe werewolf can shatter chests with moonlight bottles to regenerate moonlight.

Progression forces the player to choose to boost either their human form (better at fighting enemies)
or their werewolf form (better at avoiding traps and staying in werewolf form).

Initial tradeoffs of each form:
  Human
    Full player control
    Weak at fighting enemies
    Able to avoid traps
    Limited stamina
    Stealth, can hide, avoid attracting attention
    Can loot chests
  Werewolf
    No player control
    Powerful for fighting enemies
    Not able to avoid traps
    Unlimited stamina
    No stealth, can't hide, increased attention from enemies
    Can't loot chests
